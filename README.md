# Welcome to The Bryant Works repository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best The Bryant Works has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.
